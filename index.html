  <h2 id="p1"><span class="quote">“Now I will tell you a story, that has never been told before”</span> said <a href="#" id="link1" class="purple">Purple plasma</a> warming up their child.</h2>
  <h2 class="invisible" id="p2">Their child, a pure, eternally continuous vibration enveloped in the Crystal of Time hovering in the void, shined bright with joy anticipating the most epic story that was about to unravel <a href="#" id="link2">before their consciousness.</a></h2>
  <h2 id="p3" class="invisible"><span class="quote">Long before our time, not too far from the lands we tread on there were beings of metal and gears, flesh and bones and maybe some of <a class="fire" id="link3">fire</a>.”</span></h2>
  <h2 id="p4" class="invisible"><span class="quote">“Maybe, maybe! <a class="red" id="link4">Are you messing with me?</a>”</span> Asked the little vibration guessing their expectations won’t be met.</h2>
  <h2 id="p5" class="invisible">Be it as it may, as the story began, a glimmering spark blazed out of the purple fire hitting the Crystal and tuning its frequency into shorter and shorter waves, until it finally got so fast it exploded inside the Crystal of Time, rendering a <a class="harmony" href="#" id="link5">realm in harmony</a> with the story of the Purple Fire.</h2>
  <h2 id="p6" class="invisible"><span class="quote">“In some indefinite point in spacetime, there were rotating rocks revolving around hot rotating rocks revolving and rotating around dark very dense gooey rocks, spiraling around one another held by <a id="link6" class="harmony">invisible dark goo</a>.”</span></h2>
  <h2 id="p7" class="invisible"><span class="quote">“On one of those rocks, hot boiling ooze, gave way to some <a class="carbon" id="link7">parasitic carbon</a>.”</span></h2>
